My Porfolio! I tried having a little bit of fun with it. There's some mystic gold interactive-snow falling from the 'sky' onto 'The Vessel' just how I remember it. This interactive animation was done with Javascript and was inspired by the CodeVault project. It was honestly very finiky to work with, so let me know if you try doing something similar and get issues with it!
